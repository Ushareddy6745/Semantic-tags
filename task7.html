     <p>Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana, India. It was founded in 1591 by Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, and was originally called Bagyanagaram. The city is known as the "city of pearls" because it was once a global center for trading rare diamonds, emeralds, and natural pearls.Hyderabad is located on the Musi River in the Telangana Plateau, a major upland region of the Deccan (peninsular India). The city is at an elevation of about 1,600 feet (500 meters) and has a warm to hot and monsoonal climate with moderate annual precipitation. Most rain falls during the wet monsoon months of June to October. The Musi River divides the city into old and new city. 
        Hyderabad is highly developed in all aspects and has a rich cultural and historical tradition spanning over 400 years. The city's traditional garb reflects a mix of Muslim and South Asian influences. Bidri ware, a fine art metal handicraft that originated in the Middle East and was popularized in Hyderabad in the 18th century, is also popular in the city.

    <p>Around third century BC, the region around Hyderabad was a part of the Mauryan Empire. Following the decline of the Mauryan Empire there was an uprise by the Satavahanas who served as the feudatories to the Mauryans and founded their own Empire. The Satavahanas Empire, which ranged from Maharashtra to much of the Deccan plateau, reigned for the more than 4 centuries.
        As the rule of the Satavahanas came to an end, the area was seized by the Ikshvaku dynasty of Andhra. During the next few centuries, the region was ruled by several Hindu and Buddhist kings and eventually came under the rule of the Chalukya Kings. After the decline of the Chalukya dynasty, the state fell under the clutches of the Kakatiyas, who were feudal chieftains of the Chalukya dynasty.
        Later in 1321, the Kingdom of Warangal of the Kakatiyas, were defeated by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate and the whole region had to endure a state of anarchy for few decades. By the middle of the 15th century, the region fell in the hands of the Bahmani Sultanate which controlled the Deccan, north of the Krishna River from coast to coast.
        In 1518, Sultan Quli Qut-ul-Mulk, gained control over the region and constructed the fortress city of Golconda. He proclaimed himself as Sultan Quli Qutub Shah. In 1589, one of his descendants, Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, established the city of Hyderabad on the Musi River, five miles from Golconda.
        After Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb ascended to the throne and focused on expanding the Mughal Empire. In this pursuit, he took control over Golconda Fort, as Hyderabad was one of the wealthiest cities of the region. Though his initial attempts were thwarted, finally, in 1987 after a nine-month long battle, he captured the Golconda Fort.
        The Mughal emperor in 1724, appointed chin Qulich Khan Asaf Jah I Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, who was conferred the title of Nizam-ul-Muk, meaning the administrator of the realm. By the mid-18th century, after the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Nizam-ul-Muk seized control of the region and the Asaf Jah dynasty was founded. The descendants of Asaf Jah ruled Hyderabad as Nizams until Indiaâ€™s independence. During the Nizam rule, Hyderabad was the largest princely state in India.
